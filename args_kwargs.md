# *args and **kwargs

In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

Special Symbols Used for passing arguments:

1. *args (Non-Keyword Arguments)
2. **kwargs (Keyword Arguments)

## *args

The special syntax **args* in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-key worded, variable-length argument list.

- The syntax is to use the symbol * to take in a variable number of arguments; by convention, it is often used with the word args.
- What **args* allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined. With **args*, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
- For example : we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments and able to multiply them all together. It can be done using *args.
- Using the *, the variable that we associate with the * becomes an iterable meaning you can do things like iterate over it, run some higher-order functions such as map and filter, etc.

```python
# Python program to illustrate 
# *args for variable number of arguments
def myFun(*argv):
    for arg in argv:
        print (arg)
   
myFun('Hello', 'Welcome', 'to', 'MyTutorial')
```

## **kwargs

The special syntax ***kwargs* in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. We use the name *kwargs* with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).

- A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
- One can think of the *kwargs* as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. That is why when we iterate over the *kwargs* there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.

```python
# Python program to illustrate
# *kwargs for variable number of keyword arguments

def myFun(**kwargs):
	for key, value in kwargs.items():
		print ("%s == %s" %(key, value))

# Driver code
myFun(first ='This', mid ='is', last='MyTutorial')
```

## Using *args and **kwargs in same line to call a function

```python
def myFun(*args,**kwargs):
	print("args: ", args)
	print("kwargs: ", kwargs)

# Now we can use both *args ,**kwargs
# to pass arguments to this function :
myFun('This','is','MyTutorial',first="This",mid="is",last="MyTutorial")
```
